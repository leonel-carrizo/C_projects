## Overview
This repository contains all the projects and exercises completed during **The Piscine**, the intensive 4-week selection process of 42 London. The Piscine is an immersive program designed to teach programming fundamentals in C and Unix shell scripting through hands-on exercises, peer-to-peer learning, and collaborative projects, with no prior coding experience required.

## Project Index
Below is a list of the modules completed during The Piscine, with links to each module and a brief description:

- [**Shell00**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/Shell00): Introduction to Unix shell commands. Exercises focus on basic file manipulation, permissions, and scripting (e.g., creating files, using `ls`, `chmod`, and `grep`).
- [**Shell01**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/Shell01): Advanced Unix shell scripting. Tasks involve more complex commands, piping, and scripting techniques to automate processes.
- [**C00**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C00): Introduction to C programming. Covers basic syntax, variables, loops, and simple output functions like `ft_putchar` and `ft_print_alphabet`.
- [**C01**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C01): Variables and pointers in C. Exercises introduce pointers, basic memory manipulation, and functions like `ft_swap` and `ft_ultimate_div_mod`.
- [**C02**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C02): Strings and arrays in C. Focuses on string manipulation, array handling, and functions like `ft_strcpy` and `ft_strlen`.
- [**C03**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C03): Advanced string manipulation. Covers functions for string comparison, concatenation, and searching, such as `ft_strcmp` and `ft_strcat`.
- [**C04**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C04): Numbers and memory. Exercises involve numeric conversions, recursion, and functions like `ft_atoi` and `ft_is_prime`.
- [**C05**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C05): Iteration and recursion. Tasks explore recursive algorithms and iterative solutions, including functions like `ft_fibonacci` and `ft_sqrt`.
- [**C06**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C06): Command-line arguments in C. Focuses on parsing and handling `argc` and `argv`, with exercises like command-line string manipulation.
- [**C07**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C07): Dynamic memory allocation. Covers `malloc`, `free`, and memory management with functions like `ft_strdup` and `ft_range`.
- [**C08**](https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects/tree/main/C08): Header files and modular programming. Exercises involve creating reusable code with `.h` files and functions like `ft_boolean` and group projects.

Each module folder contains individual exercises (e.g., `ex00`, `ex01`) with source code in C and, where applicable, header files (`.h`) or test files (`main.c`).

## Technologies
- **Primary Language**: C
- **Tools**: Unix terminal, Git, GCC
- **Environment**: Linux (42 London setup)

## Purpose
This repository documents my progress during The Piscine, showcasing my skills in C programming and problem-solving. It serves as a portfolio for future projects and career opportunities in tech.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/leonel-carrizo/C_projects.git`
2. Navigate to the desired module folder (e.g., `cd C01`).
3. Compile the `.c` files using GCC, e.g., `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ex00/ft_ft.c main.c -o test`
4. Run the generated program: `./test`

**Note**: Some exercises require a custom `main.c` to test functionality. Refer to 42's exercise guidelines for specific requirements.
